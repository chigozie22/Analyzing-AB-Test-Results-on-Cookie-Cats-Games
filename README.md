# Analyzing-AB-Test-Results-on-Cookie-Cats-Games
This is a Data Science Project to analyze the effects of implemeting two difference measures in a Game. The first measure implements a wait period when the user gets to Gate 30 and the second measure does the same when a user gets to gate 40. 
Analysis of the effects of these measures on user enjoyment and retention rates provide explanation to why the first measure generates more user retention than the latter. 

A popular Data Science statistical Random Sampling technique known as Bootstrapping is used in this project to check that the assumptions are valid.
